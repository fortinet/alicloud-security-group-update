# Introduction
This AliCloud Function works with a Fortigate Automation Action to change the security group of a requested ECS instance to one specified in an environment variable. This function uses Node.js 8 and works by first describing and filtering the instances in the specified Region by IP address, and then attaching the pre-defined Security Group to that instance.

# Set up the AliCloud function

This function requires a RAM user to be setup with an AccessKey and Secret. For details on creating a RAM user, refer to the AliCloud article [Create a RAM user](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28637.htm?spm=a2c63.p38356.b99.13.378647c9NkDOum).

  1. In the Ali Console, under **Elastic Computing**, select **Function Compute**.
  2. Select a region (top left). It is recommended that you set up the service in the same region as your ECS instances.
  3. Click **Create Service**.
  4. Enter a **Service Name** and click **OK**.
  5. In the new service, click **Create Function**.
  6. Under **Function Template**, select **Empty Function**.
  7. Under **Configure Triggers**, select **HTTP Trigger**.
  8. Enter a **Trigger Name** and set the **Authorization** (**Function** is recommended).
  9. Under **Method**, select **POST**.
  10. Under **Configure Function Settings**, enter a **Function Name**.
  11. Set the **Runtime** to **Nodejs8**.
  12. Set the following **Environment Variables**:
      * **REGION_ID:** The region your ECS instances are in.
      * **SECURITY_GROUP_ID:** The Security Group you will add to your Instances.
      * **ACCESS_KEY_ID:** The AccessKey set up with the RAM user.
      * **ACCESS_KEY_SECRET:** The Secret associated with the AccessKey.
      * **ENDPOINT:** The endpoint associated with your region (Mappings can be found [here](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/31837.htm)).
  13. Set **Permissions** for the function. At minimum, **Read** and **Write** to ECS are required.
  14. Under the **Code** tab, copy the provided `index.js` code into the editor and click **Save**.

The link to your HTTP Trigger will be displayed below the editor. You will use this in the next section.

# Set up the FortiGate

  1. Log into your FortiGate.
  2. Select **Security Fabric > Automation**.
  3. Click **Create New**.
  4. Enter a **Name**.
  5. Under **Trigger**, select **Compromised Host**.
  6. Under **Action**, select **AliCloud Function**.
